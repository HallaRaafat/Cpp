# LMS #Matrix

One of the functions of the Learning Management System (LMS) is to provide
teachers with tools to view and analyze students’ grades. The aim of this exercise
is to import students’ data and perform some statistical operations such as
normalization and transform them into symbol grades representation. The
program should have a menu of the following functions:
• Import/export student data... • Import/export
student grade
• Modify grades:
o Normalize
o export GPA grades

My first Project in CPP was 
Design a Matrix Calculator:
1- The user should choose the size of the matrix (2x2) or (3x3)
2- The user will choose if he will input 1 or 2 matrices
3- The user will input the value of the matrix (or matrices)
4- The user will choose one of the following operations to be done
a. Addition
b. Subtraction
c. Multiplication
d. Determinant of the matrix (only needs 1 matrix)
e. Inverse of the matrix (only needs 1 matrix)
f. Quit
5- The user can choose to do another operation after the first operation done
on new matrices or on the same values before
6- The calculator does not quit unless the user chooses to
