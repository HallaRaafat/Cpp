# LMS

One of the functions of the Learning Management System (LMS) is to provide
teachers with tools to view and analyze students’ grades. The aim of this exercise
is to import students’ data and perform some statistical operations such as
normalization and transform them into symbol grades representation. The
program should have a menu of the following functions:
• Import/export student data... • Import/export
student grade
• Modify grades:
o Normalize
o export GPA grades
